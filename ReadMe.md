# This will be the readme file for my first proper web app project! 

Updated 29 August, 2022

There's nothing much to this project so far. Very minimally interactive, but we're building up a selection of pages to browse through

Web app pages:

/site (and /chairs): A basic Chair search bar page. Takes an input, which is successfully received, but nothing is done based on it yet. [main_page.ejs]

/catalog: Redirects from search bar input in the chairs page. Meant to simulate a digital storefront results page. [search_results.ejs]

/friendly: Just there for the sake of it. Messing around with cool CSS functionality [friendly.ejs]
